Rice prices rise on flash floods
[Rice prices rise on flash floods ]

Rice prices edged up as large millers are cashing in on crop losses, caused by the recent flash floods in the greater Sylhet region, amid depleting stocks from previous harvests and low imports, said traders.

In Dhaka, retail prices of coarse rice such as the swarna variety rose to a new level of Tk 40-42 a kilogram now, up 6.49 percent from Tk 37-40 a week ago.

Prices of the medium and fine categories of the staple also went up between 1.96 percent and 4.65 percent in the last one week, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

The prices rose in other parts of the country as well.

Millers and traders said rice prices typically go up near the end of a season for dwindling stocks.

“There is a shortage of paddy in the market. The small mills do not have paddy, and neither do the large mills. Those who had paddy might have milled the grain to empty their storages and make space for freshly harvested grains,” said Chitta Majumder, managing director of Majumder Group of Industries that operates an auto rice mill.

Every year, paddy markets usually get an initial supply from harvests from the haor or seasonal water bodies in the northeastern region. Farmers in the region usually begin to harvest their crops in the third week of April.

However, floods in the haor regions have not only affected standing crops and caused losses to growers but also dampened prospects of an early arrival of fresh paddy, said Nirod Boron Saha, a wholesaler in Naogaon, one of the main rice trading hubs in the northwest.

“We usually rely on supplies from the haor region until harvests in the north begins; it keeps prices stable in the initial days of the harvest season.”

The haor areas account for nearly 10 percent of the total boro cultivation area at about 48 lakh hectares this year.

The flood has affected 1.40 lakh hectares of paddy in the fields, according to estimates of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).

Saha said speculation over delayed harvest for the bad weather is another reason for the recent price spiral as farmers, small and medium millers and wholesalers do not have paddy stocks.

“Only large mills have grains now,” he said.

Bappi Saha, a rice miller from the northeastern district of Netrokona, said, “This may be an artificial shortage.” The price hike is temporary, he added.

“The government, for the time being, can reduce the import duty on rice to encourage imports and increase the supply in the market,” he said.

Rice imports by private traders slumped 65 percent to 76,600 tonnes in July-March of the current fiscal year from the same time last year, after the government hiked the duty from 20 percent to 28 percent to ensure that growers get fair prices for their produce.

Boro, one of the three rice crop seasons in a year, accounts for nearly 55 percent of the country's annual rice output of 3.47 crore tonnes.

DAE earlier targeted to ensure the production of 1.91 crore tonnes of rice during the current boro season to attain the total output goal of 3.51 crore tonnes for this fiscal year.

Rice production in the two crop seasons -- aus and aman -- rose 0.11 percent to nearly 1.58 crore tonnes year-on-year, according to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Aus output declined but aman production rose, according to the BBS.

Fresh spike in rice prices

Prices of all varieties of rice crept up owing to crop losses for flash floods, rainfall, disease attacks on standing paddy and depleting stocks.

The price of the coarse variety of rice went up 13 percent to Tk 42-45 a kilogram at retail levels in Dhaka yesterday, from Tk 37-40 a month ago.

Year-on-year, the price of coarse rice, which is an indicator of the rice market, rose 32 percent yesterday, according to data from Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).

The price of the medium and fine grains also edged up -- by Tk 2-4 a kilogram -- over the weekend, according to TCB and the Department of Agricultural Marketing.

“There is a shortage of rice at the mills while the stock of paddy is nil as well. The flood-induced damage of paddy in the haor region and recent rainfalls came as a blow for the market,” said KM Layek Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Auto, Major and Husking Mills Association.

The price spike of the staple comes at a time when stocks at the public warehouses hit a six-year low and imports slumped due to a duty hike. At this time of year, stocks from the previous harvest typically begin to dwindle and fresh paddy harvests come in from the haor regions in the northeast, said traders and millers.

But floods in the back swamps have wiped out crops, causing a loss of 4.5 lakh tonnes of cereal, according to the government's primary estimates.

“There is no hope. It would be tough to recover the losses,” Ali said.

With farmers struggling to recover a part of their crops in the hoar areas, rainfall and floods affected standing boro in some districts in the northwest as well.

The attack of fungal diseases in some fields has worsened the situation, dampening prospects for boro paddy that accounts for about 55 percent of the total annual supply of the staple at 3.47 crore tonnes.

The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) earlier projected the production of 1.91 crore tonnes of rice in the current boro season, as part of its goal of bagging 3.51 crore tonnes in fiscal 2016-17. Millers said farmers in the northwest usually begin harvests at the end of April. But it is yet to start in full swing.

“There is an acute shortage of paddy in the local haats in the growing areas. Wherever there is a supply of fresh harvests, buyers are rushing to the spot. There also are reports of advance selling by some millers,” he said.

Abdur Rashid Dawan, proprietor of Matin Rice Agency, a commission agent at the rice wholesale depot of Babubazar in Dhaka, said millers could not supply the required quantity of rice because of inadequate supplies.

He placed orders for 30 tonnes of rice with a miller last week; the miller supplied half the order. “I will contact the mill again tomorrow (today).”

The supply of paddy remains low as many farmers could not harvest the already matured paddy because of bad weather, he said.

“Rainfall has also delayed ripening of the grain. But it appears that supply will rise in a week, if the current weather continues.”

Towfiqul Islam Khan, research fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said a diminished stock of rice and loss of boro crops are promoting speculation in the rice market.

The rising price of coarse rise is particularly affecting the extreme poor working in the non-farm informal sector, including the urban slum dwellers.

This group spends about 40 percent of their total income on rice, he added. “It is critical to enhance efforts towards country-wide open market sales and relief works in the flood affected haor areas.”

Khan said the rising prices may also affect boro season procurement, as the offered price may not appear lucrative.  The government must keep a close eye on it and explore import options, he added.

The government aims to buy seven lakh tonnes of paddy and eight lakh tonnes of rice during the harvest of boro at Tk 24 and Tk 34, which is 4 percent and 6 percent higher than last year's.

Coarse rice price soars
42pc rise in a year; govt to import 3 lakh tonnes of rice on urgent basis
[Coarse rice price soars]
Reaz Ahmad

Among the essential commodities, coarse rice price registered the highest rise in the last one year, according to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) which keeps track of prices of daily necessities.

Prices of coarse rice, mostly consumed by the poor and people of lower-middle income groups, went up 42 percent since June last year.

Even though the private sector imported one lakh tonne of rice during that time, paying 25 percent import duty, the price of a kg of coarse rice was Tk 45-46 this week. In the first week of June 2016, it was Tk 30-34 a kg.

Though prices of finer and medium quality rice varieties registered 9 to 20 percent rise during the same period, price hike of coarse rice was worrying the government.

To add to its worries, public granaries now only have 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice, a six-year low yearend stock.

Over 10 lakh tonnes of boro crop were lost this year to early flooding in seven haor districts and fungi (rice blast) attack in 19 districts.

These forced the government to renew a 2011 memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Vietnam for 3 lakh tonnes of emergency rice imports. Three international tenders have also been floated during the last fortnight for importing 1.5 lakh tonnes more.

A day after the finance minister placed 2017-18 fiscal year's budget in parliament, Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury said rice prices went up due to sudden floods in the haor areas and that prices would come down quickly as the government took steps to import rice.

However, the government's rather late move to stabilise the rice market would yield no immediate results with local millers reluctant to sell to the food department for a non-lucrative price offered by the government. The government's rice imports are unlikely to reach ports before the end of July.  

To make matters worse, market sources told The Daily Star that prices of rice in the international market have been rising for the last two weeks.

Sources at the food ministry and the office of the Director General of Food said the government floated three international tenders in quick succession in May and in the first week of June seeking to buy 1 lakh tonnes of parboiled (Shiddo) and another 50,000 tonnes of white rice (Atap).

Dubai-based Sukhbir Agro Energy quoted the lowest price, $427.85 a tonne, for 50,000 tonnes of parboiled rice (first tender) and Singapore-based Agrocorp International quoted the lowest price, $406.48 a tonne, for 50,000 tonnes of white rice (second tender). 

The bids for the third tender, for 50,000 tonnes of parboiled rice, are scheduled to be opened on June 11, food ministry sources said.

As it stands now with 25 percent levies on imported rice, the government would have to pay Tk 44 for each kg of imported rice, Tk 10 more than what it offers farmers and millers.

Though the government had plans of buying 13 lakh tonnes of rice from the domestic market this boro season, its offer of Tk 34 a kg fell far short of farmers' and traders' desires. They are now selling at Tk 42-44 a kg in the domestic market.

A month has gone by since official boro procurement began and the government could only sign contracts with millers for 1.6 lakh tonnes of rice. There is no guarantee that the government would actually get that 1.6 lakh tonne of rice.

Food Minister Quamrul Islam acknowledged in parliament on Monday that the government's rice stock was low. He said the process to import six lakh tonnes of rice was underway.

Meanwhile, a recent report of the Vietnam Economic Times stated that Vietnam would sell up to 10 lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh every year until 2022, under an extended MoU first signed in 2011.

Bangladesh did not need to import rice since 2011-12 financial year but after renewing the MoU, it immediately wanted to purchase 2.5 to 3 lakh tonnes of rice and a total of 5 lakh tonnes of rice by the end of 2017, according to the Vietnam News Agency.

The government's Food Planning and Monitoring Unit's (FPMU) May 31 report stated that rice prices went up in the international market over the last fortnight. It recorded that prices of Indian, Thai and Vietnamese rice increased up to 8 percent.

Market sources said the Philippines was in the international market to buy rice along with flood-ravaged Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, which caused the price hike.

The curious case of rice price hike
[The curious case of rice price hike]

Reaz Ahmad

A minister was telling me the other day that if people don't mind spending Tk. 300 on a cheese burger, why can't they afford a little more for rice? His comment obviously came in reference to the current high price of the staple in the retail market. Supporting his comment, someone asked, isn't this government providing the ultra-poor with food doles — giving them cushion against the high rice price in the market?

Obviously, they had essentially failed to take into account the overwhelming majority of people who are either poor, or belong to the lower middle-income bracket — who neither fall into the relatively small category of ultra-poor, nor the marginal category of burger-eaters. They are not taken care of. Any rapid and unusual surge of rice price (as is happening now) would definitely dent their wallets and dent it deep.

We'll deal with the rice-skipping, burger-munching minority of urban youths later. Let's talk about the ultra-poor first. In fact, today's abnormal hike in rice price is apparently connected to a government initiative of providing the ultra-poor with rice at Tk. 10 per kg. 

In the latter half of last year, the government started enlisting five million ultra-poor with an aim of feeding them with 7.5 lakh tonnes of rice in the subsequent five months at a rate (Tk. 10 per kg) that is a fourth of the market price. This programme has been running since September 2016 along with the government's hundred other social safety net programmes, many of which are also related to food aid.

While the government was in a frenzy doling out low-cost rice to the ultra-poor, it nearly exhausted its safe level of rice stock in the public granaries. Its food department completely failed to prepare for what was coming and did next to nothing to replenish the dried up rice stock. The stock fell below a nadir at 1.85 lakh tonnes, a 10-year low in this country. 

Independent think tanks, farm and food sector experts and economists forewarned the government not to allow such depletion of rice in its stock. But for whatever reason (only the government can explain), it allowed the freefall of rice stock. This weakened the government's position and made it difficult for any sort of market intervention, at which point profit-mongering rice traders started to benefit.

Things got further complicated when unusually early flash-floods washed away, according to the most conservative estimate, 10 lakh tonnes of rice in the northeastern back-swamps — where winter Boro rice is the only major cereal that grows in a crop year. On top of that, we lost more Boro rice in fungal attack (rice blast) in as many as 19 districts. Up until now, the Department of Agricultural Extension has not come up with any concrete estimation on fungi-induced crop losses. 

No matter how slow the government apparatuses move in making trustworthy loss assessments, rice millers and private traders were smart enough to recognise a looming supply shortage in the market. As they started to push the price up, it still didn't occur to the concerned government departments that they should intervene to ensure higher availability of rice. 

The food department rather missed a chance to replenish the rice stock, completely failed to procure paddy directly from the farmers early into the Boro harvesting season and then made a late entry into the market, that too, with non-lucrative price offers. The result was obvious. Why should rice millers — who can easily fetch Tk. 39-40 for each kilogram of rice in the open market — sell rice to the government at Tk. 34 a kg? 

After the state-run agency, Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, showed through market analysis how prices of the coarse varieties of rice jumped 47 percent in June, comparing it to the corresponding period of 2016, the government thought of buying rice from the international market. It struck at least three deals to ship in 3.5 lakh tonnes of rice; but it is unlikely to reach before early July. The government also took a long time in deciding that it should decrease a high tariff (28 percent) on rice import.

In fact, such high tariffs on rice import deterred the private sector from importing rice in a crop-loss year — which is rather unusual. One can now easily and very legitimately raise the question: Who pushed up the rice price? Why did we allow rice stock to deplete in the first place? Why didn't we replenish the stock while going full throttle with newer rice dole schemes? Why did we fail in procuring rice from the farmers early in the season? And, why did it take us so long to lower the duty on rice import?

In a country with more than 160 million people, the ultra-poor and burger-eaters are definitely a minority. I beg to differ with the notion that one should not worry about high rice prices — where burger-eaters can take care of themselves (even with the finance minister slapping a 15 percent VAT on top of the 10 percent supplementary duty on fast food) and the government takes care of the ultra-poor — because of a simple reason. There are still millions of others in this country whose quality of life is compromised when coarse rice price jumps from Tk. 30 per kg to Tk. 48. As they are now pushed up against the wall, what they will essentially have to do is consume less rice which is the only major source of energy for many and/or cut down their expenditure on other food items such as vegetables, fruits, etc.

Millers, wholesalers to blame for rice price spiral: USDA
Sohel Parvez

Millers and wholesalers have mainly pushed rice prices higher, cashing in on supply shortages owing to floods and blast attack on the recently harvested boro rice, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

But some of the millers and wholesalers admitted that many of them slowed down purchasing and milling operations to let prices climb, said the agency in its Bangladesh Grain and Feed Update that was released on July 19.

Flooding damaged over one million tonnes of boro rice crop across 400,000 hectares of wetlands, locally known as haor, in the northeastern regions and lowlands in nine districts, according to the USDA.

The loss was aggravated by a fungi or neck blast attack on a limited area of boro rice crop in several northern and southern districts of the country, it added.

Subsequently, the USDA lowered its boro rice production estimate to 17.8 million tonnes.

The damage from flooding reduced harvests enough to drive the farm gate prices of paddy up 29-60 percent last year.

The surge was further fuelled by some traders hoarding paddy to drive prices even higher. Despite the higher farm gate prices for paddy, farmers had small net margins after deducting losses caused by the flooding and disease.

“In the end, it was largely millers and wholesalers who pushed rice prices up.”

The USDA's report comes at a time when the prices of coarse rice, which is mostly consumed by the poor and lower middle-income people, dropped marginally from its historic high of Tk 47.30 each kilogram in June.

The retail prices of coarse rice were Tk 42-45 per kilogram yesterday thanks to increased imports after reduction of import duty by the government to 10 percent from previous 28 percent.

Despite the fall, coarse rice prices were 36 percent higher yesterday from a year earlier, according to data from the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.

Besides, the massive cutback in open market sales of rice last fiscal year fuelled price speculation.

The USDA said rice prices have been increasing since August last year, and the recent aman and boro rice harvest did little to relieve the pressure: prices remain their highest in eight years.

Rice prices began creeping up last year after the government hiked import duty to ensure farmers get better prices for their crops. Later, depleting stocks, particularly in public warehouses, coupled with low import caused the rice prices to remain higher.

To contain the price spiral and raise stock in public warehouses, the government also started buying the staple from global market for the first time in five years.

The agency said Bangladesh's rice import would rise to 1.2 million tonnes in the current fiscal year thanks to robust consumer demand, expansion of the food safety net programme, lower public stocks, and relaxed trade and financial policy.

Rice imports slumped 48 percent year-on-year to 133,000 tonnes in fiscal 2016-17.  Since July 1, 102,800 tonnes of the grain were imported, according to food ministry data.

Govt to further slash duty on rice import
Goes for deal with Thailand to buy the staple
[Govt to further slash duty on rice import]

In a desperate bid to stabilise rice price, the government has decided to further reduce the duty on import of the staple and strike a deal with Thailand to buy rice.

Meanwhile, private importers, anticipating the duty slash, are delaying in having the already imported rice released at the country's two main land ports -- Hili in Dinajpur and Benapole in Jessore.

Over 200 trucks loaded with some 7,000 tonnes of rice were standing still at the ports yesterday.

As rice prices continue to remain high, the food ministry on July 25 proposed to allow import of the staple on zero tariffs.  

On Tuesday, the commerce ministry informed the parliamentary standing committee concerned that the government would halve the import duty from 10 percent.

Bahauddin Nasim, a member of the parliamentary body on the ministry, told The Daily Star yesterday although the food ministry insisted on lifting the duty altogether, the government would keep a five percent duty on rice import.

Till last night, the National Board of Revenue, however, did not receive any communications in this regard.

But speculation over an imminent duty cut prompted private importers to go slow with the release of already imported rice consignments from India.

On June 20, the government reduced duty on rice import from 28 percent to 10 percent. As a result, the country witnessed over 2.4 lakh tonnes of rice import in the last one and a half months. This volume is almost double the entire volume of rice imported by private traders in the last financial year.   

Mamunur Rashid, an importer, told our Dinajpur correspondent Kongkon Karmaker yesterday that they were taking time in unloading the imported rice as they heard that the government would lower the duty further.

“We are waiting for a final decision from the government,” said Rashedul Islam, a Clearing and Forwarding Agent at Hili Land port.

As many as 138 loaded trucks were parked at the port, said Sohrab Hossain, public relation officer of Panama Port Link Ltd at Hili. Import of rice would go up further once the duty is cut off, he said.

Our Benapole correspondent Mohsin Milon reported that 65 rice-laden trucks were kept in port area as importers were waiting to reap the duty-cut benefit.

Meanwhile, a Thai delegation is due in the city today to sign a government-to-government (G2G) deal with the food ministry for export of the staple to Bangladesh.

However, ministry sources yesterday declined to reveal the price at which the government is going to buy the rice from Thailand, which in last month had asked for a high price ($500 a tonne). The price, however, was not agreed by Bangladesh.

Besides, a Cambodian official delegation is also due sometime next week to decide on rice price. Last week, a MoU (memorandum of understanding) was signed between Bangladesh and Cambodia for the import of

10 lakh tonnes of rice from the Southeast Asian country in next five years.

After with Cambodia, if the deal is signed with Thailand today, it would be the third such import deal in two months since the government approved import of 2.5 lakh tonnes of rice from Vietnam under a separate G2G agreement.

Besides, over the past two months, the Directorate General of Food floated seven international tenders seeking to import an additional 3.5 lakh tonnes of rice.

The moves come long after the crop loss in the March flashflood, which ravaged the backswamps in the country's northeastern region where 90 percent of standing Boro crops, totalling over 10 lakh tonnes, were damaged. Fungal attacks in at least 19 districts also caused crop loss in the last Boro season.

With the Cambodian deal signed, 8.5 lakh tonnes of rice is now lined up for import, which still falls short of a projected import need of 12 lakh tonnes. A recent US Department of Agriculture projection, however, put the figure at 15 lakh tonnes in the current fiscal.

The food ministry's move also comes at a time when end-season rice stock in public granaries dropped to a six-year low and market price of coarse rice shot up to as high as Tk 48 a kg in June-July. This is a 47 percent rise from the price during the same period last year.

Despite government moves and increased imports by the private sector, a Trading Corporation of Bangladesh's market monitoring report shows that the price of coarse rice has remained static at Tk 45 a kg for over two weeks.

Star Report

Prices of rice have edged up amid the government's ongoing purchase, falling supply from farmers and flood in the country's northern region, said millers and traders.

In Dhaka, retail prices of coarse rice rose by 6.45 percent to Tk 32-34 per kg from Tk 30-32 a month ago, according to the Department of Agricultural Marketing.

Prices of the staple also soared in Rangpur and Dinajpur due to supply shortages as millers prefer delivering to government warehouses at Tk 32 a kg, reports our Dinajpur correspondent.

Fine rice, including miniket and paizam, has also become dearer. A 50 kg bag of fine rice was selling between Tk 2,400 and 2,600 at a rice wholesale market in Mahiganj of Rangpur town on Sunday, up from between Tk 2,000 and Tk 2,200 two to three weeks ago, said traders.

According to some buyers and traders, prices of coarse rice have increased by nearly Tk 6 per kg in some areas of Rangpur and Dinajpur over the last two to three weeks. On Sunday, the commodity was trading at up to Tk 33 each kg, up from Tk 26 two to three weeks ago.

“How come prices go up so fast? Is there any rule?” questioned an annoyed Ibrahim Ali in Bahadurbazaar of Dinajpur town.

He claimed of buying a kg of BR-11 rice for Tk 33 this week, which he could get for Tk 26 two weeks ago at the rice markets in Bahadurbazaar. He blamed syndication of traders for the price hike.

Visiting the markets in the area on Sunday, The Daily Star found that coarse and medium-grain rice was traded at between Tk 1,600 and Tk 1,800 per 50 kgs. Some traders said the same quantity of rice was sold between Tk 1,300 and 1,500 two to three weeks ago.

“The current price is quite high for me,” said Masud Rana, a rickshaw puller in Rangpur. He urged the government to look into the matter.

Early this month, the Directorate General of Food started procuring rice as per contracts with millers. The food office aims to buy five lakh tonnes of parboiled rice and 50,000 tonnes of sundried rice from the boro crop, harvesting of which ended in June.

The office earlier bought 6.69 lakh tonnes of paddy at Tk 23 per kg during the boro season.

As of August 16, the food office bought 44,763 tonnes of rice, according to food ministry data. The government procures rice to create a stock and to give price support to growers.

KM Layek Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Auto, Major and Husking Mills Association, said rice prices increased owing to rising prices of paddy. The government's procurement of paddy was the main reason behind the price spiral, he pointed out.

Prices of almost all varieties of paddy rose by up to Tk 300 each maund (40 kilograms) since the end of the boro season, he said, adding that the market saw poor supply of coarse paddy since the beginning of public procurement.

He said marginal farmers do not have paddy in their hand now. “Big-scale farmers and traders who hold back their stock now have paddy,” he added.

Some traders said big-scale farmers and stockists have slowed down the supply of paddy assuming that import of rice would be very expensive due to duty hike by the government.

“Many millers are also buying from local markets to deliver rice to public warehouses,” said Layek.

The government imposed 25 percent duty on rice import in the current fiscal year to protect interest of farmers.

Sheikh Abul Kashem, secretary of Rangpur Rice Millers Association, said big merchants were holding their stock. He hoped supply would improve by the end of this month.

Abdur Rashid, owner of Matin Rice at Mohammdapur Krishi Market in Dhaka, said prices of the staple have been on the rise since the Eid-ul-Fitr early last month. He attributed the price hike to higher paddy prices.

Prices of fine and medium quality rice increased by Tk 4-6 per kg since May this year owing to spike in paddy prices, said Nirod Boron Saha, a wholesaler and commission agent in Naogaon, one of the main rice trading hubs in the country's north.

Saha, also president of Dhan O Chal Aratdar O Byabosayee Samity in Naogaon, blamed the price spiral on slow supply of paddy from big farmers and traders.

He said higher prices of coarse rice might affect low-income and working class people.

“But the price hike is not abnormal. Increase in prices appears to be tolerable from the view point of increased wages of day labourers,” he added.

Failing to import parboiled (Shiddo) rice from Myanmar due to high price, the government yesterday approved another deal to import 50,000 tonnes of rice through international tender.

A Thai-based company has agreed to provide Bangladesh with parboiled rice at $438 per tonne, $47 less than the asking price of Myanmar.

Meanwhile, a day after three ministers held a meeting with rice traders, millers and importers in the capital and fulfilled some of their demands, rice prices at wholesale markets started showing a downtrend.

Coarse rice prices, which shot up to Tk 47/48 a kg in the wholesale markets and up to Tk 54 a kg in the retail markets, came down by Tk 4 a kg at the wholesale level yesterday.

Market sources attributed the price fall to release of rice by many of the millers from their godown stocks.

Importers at Benapole land port told The Daily Star that once the circular allowing use of poly-bags instead of jute sacks for rice packing reaches there, the prices would fall further. 

Bangladesh Rice Millers' Association President Abdur Rashid said consumers at the retail level would get price fall benefits in three to four days.

A visiting Myanmar official delegation on Monday agreed to provide Bangladesh with just one lakh tonnes of white (Atap) rice at $442 a tonne but didn't budge from their asking price of $485 per tonne for parboiled rice.

Amid a spiraling of rice prices in domestic markets, the government struck deals, both through tenders and government-to-government arrangements (G2G), to import as much as 9 lakh tonnes of the staple, two-third of which is white rice.  

While allocating this white rice for an extended Open Market Sale (OMS) operation, the government found that the sale of subsidised food grains drew little response from people here who prefer parboiled rice over white one. 

Food Secretary Kaikobad Hossain told reporters in Dhaka that of the total expected import volume, two lakh tonnes had so far reached public food granaries while another 1.5 lakh tonnes were expected to reach land ports soon.

Some 5.5 lakh tonne more rice would be brought in by November, Kaikobad added.   

The government had decided to import as much as 20 lakh tonnes of food grains (15 lakh tonnes of rice and 5 lakh tonnes of wheat) in the ongoing fiscal year following crop loss in excess of 20 lakh tonnes due to haor flashfloods and rice blasts. 

Though it succeeded striking G2G deals with Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar for importing rice, most of it was white rice. Government efforts to sign deals with India and Thailand for import of parboiled rice did not yield results as both the countries asked for exorbitant prices -- over $500 per tonne.

Asked why the government went for relatively pricey imports through G2G arrangement while rice is available at cheaper rates through open tenders, the food secretary yesterday told reporters that there was no quality concern in case of G2G rice, while private parties on winning bids sometimes tended to compromise the quality.

Besides, the government-to-government deals guarantee quicker shipment, he added.

A day after the food minister's announcement that the OMS programme would be extended from district to upazila level, the subsidised food grains sale programme could not be launched in most upazilas yesterday.

In most of the areas, dealers selected by the food department for OMS programme were busy depositing money in banks and collecting the rice allocated from the government silos in their respective districts. 

Our correspondents from Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Natore sent dispatches that dealers would begin the OMS operation today.

In another development, the government postponed distribution of rice at Tk 10 a kg among 50 lakh ultra poor across the country due to insufficient rice stock in public grannaries.

Food officials said the priority was to operate OMS programme on a wider scale now over Food Friendly Programme. Together these two programmes would require more than 6 lakh tonnes of rice but the government's food reserve currently has only 3.4 lakh tonnes of rice.
